Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project: What does the current project do?  Include improvements you made in the description. 
This project fetch live information from the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority): https://api-v3.mbta.com, so you can track the LIVE position of two different buses from Line 1 that travels between the MIT campus and Harvard's Campus. You can click on each marker and it will pop up the name ("id") of the bus. 

How to Run: 
Download all files on the repo in the same folder.
Open the index.html.
If the map doesn't load, you need to go https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/ singup for free and get a new token and replace in the script.js in line 2.

Roadmap of future improvements: 

The next step is to set the icon of each marker(wich represents each bus), so it can be easier to follow each bus.
